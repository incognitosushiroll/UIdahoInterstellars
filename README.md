# SPEL - Open Star Tracker (SOST)

## Idaho Interstellars Modification

### Star Tracker Linux Setup
1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/incognitosushiroll/UIdahoInterstellars
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential protobuf-compiler python3-venv socat
```
3. Setup project
```bash
cd UIdahoInterstellars/RPi
./linux_installer.sh
./extract_cat.sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
protoc --python_out=. stt.proto
```

Now you can run the demo on your device \:)

### Star Tracker Serial Communication Demo
Do this once you have setup the project.
1. Create a fake serial "cable":
```bash
socat -d2 pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0
```
Note the two paths that socat prints: `/dev/pts/x` and `/dev/pts/y`.
2. Start `stt.py`:
```bash
cd ~/Star_Tracker/RPi
source .venv/bin/activate
python stt.py /dev/pts/x # replace x with what socat returned
```
3. Use `demo.py`:
```bash
cd ~/Star_Tracker/RPi
source .venv/bin/activate
python demo.py /dev/pts/y sample_rpi 5 -n 22 # replace y with what socat returned
```
Try different values for `-n` (chooses a sample image from `Star_Tracker/RPi/Sample_images/RPi`). See `python demo.py -h` for more options.

## 1.- Overview

This GitHub offers to the CubeSat research community an open-source Star Tracker (STT), 
developed at the Space and Planetary Exploration Laboratory (SPEL) at the University of Chile. 
We used this development in the first Chilean satellite swarm made up of SUCHAI-2/3 and PlantSAT. <br/>
SUCHAI-1 was the first NanoSatellite developed by the University of Chile at SPEL. Launched on June 23 (2017), this satellite 
worked 457 days on space. On April 1, 2022, the second batch of satellites was launched: the SUCHAI-2/3 and PlantSAT.
We tested the pointing capabilities of these new satellites and learned how to develop a robust attitude
determination and control system (ADCS) through in-house sensors and algorithms development. <br/>

The image shows the STT payload being integrated into the SUCHAI-2 nanosatellite. The RPi Zero W is attached following 
the PC-104 standard, with the RPi V2.1 camera and the associated electronics to make it work properly.

## 2.- Description

- This GitHub contains a fully functional STT you can test on a Linux PC. Nevertheless, the main idea 
is to use it with a Raspberry Pi (RPi) and its camera (V2.1) in an autonomous way.
- This code is currently working on *Python 3.10*. All the code and the necessary files are in the **RPi** folder.
- This GitHub is **free** and **open** to everyone interested in using it, **especially researchers working on CubeSats.** 
We encourage interested researchers to help this project grow!

## 3.- Installation instructions

1. Two open software commonly used in the astronomy field are the base of this STT code: [Source Extractor](https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor)
and [Match](http://spiff.rit.edu/match/). To properly use this STT, you first need to install these two software. In a Linux computer, you 
can do it using the bash script provided in *RPi/linux_installer.sh*: <br />
```bash
cd RPi
sh linux_installer.sh
```
In our implementation, we use version **2.19.5** of Source Extractor and version **0.14** of Match. However, using
newer version of Source Extractor should not be a problem for the algorithm. <br />

2. For memory reasons, star catalogs are compressed (tar.gz). You can decompress it using the batch script
in *RPi/extract_cat.sh*: <br />
```bash
cd RPi
sh extract_cat.sh
```

3. This STT software uses the following *Python* libraries:
- argparse
- [astropy](http://www.astropy.org)
- itertools
- multiprocessing
- numpy
- os
- pillow
- platform
- re
- subprocess
- time

Most of them come by default in *Python*, and the remaining can be installed by typing in the terminal:
```bash
python3 -m pip install astropy pillow
```

## 4.- Use instructions

This STT software works by comparing the grabbed picture with a stellar catalog. The different catalog segments can 
be separated by 5, 10, or 15 degrees. The larger the catalog separation, the faster the algorithm works, but the 
less accurate the solution. You can choose the catalog separation when you run the code. <br />
You can test this STT software in three different ways:
- Directly grabbing pictures with the RPi and the V2.1 camera.
- Using the sample images previously grabbed with the RPi V2.1 camera.
- Using the sample images from the satellite STEREO HI-1.

### 4.1.- Taking pictures with the RPi and the V2.1 camera
The syntax is the following:
```bash
python3 stt.py direct_rpi <catalog-division>
```
Catalog division can be 5, 10 or 15. This will acquire a picture with a predefined exposure time of 800 ms. If you 
want to set your own exposure time, you can try:
```bash
python3 stt.py direct_rpi <catalog-division> --exptime <exposure-time>
```
The exposure time is in **ms**.

### 4.2.- Using RPi sample images
The syntax is the following:
```bash
python3 stt.py sample_rpi <catalog-division>
```
Catalog division can be 5, 10 or 15. This will apply the algorithm over the first picture in the sample images. If you 
want to try another picture, you can try:
```bash
python3 stt.py sample_rpi <catalog-division> --npic <picture-number>
```
The argument *picture-number* ranges from 1 to 50.

### 4.3.- Using [STEREO](https://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) sample pictures

This STT software can also be tested with pictures from the [HI-1 detector](http://www.stereo.rl.ac.uk/) from the STEREO mission. This procedure 
proves that different cameras can be used with this algorithm, and it is not attached to particular hardware. <br />
The STEREO HI-1 pictures can have different processing levels. These levels are well explained 
in [STEREO HI data processing documentation](https://www.ukssdc.ac.uk/solar/stereo/documentation/HI_processing.html). We use two different image format:

- L0 images, which can be downloaded from [STEREO SCIENCE CENTER - L0](https://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/pub/ins_data/secchi/L0/a/img/hi_1/).
- L2 images, which can be downloaded from [STEREO SCIENCE CENTER - L2](https://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/pub/ins_data/secchi_hi/L2/a/img/hi_1/).

There are examples of pictures of both kinds in folder *RPi/Sample_images/STEREO* <br />
To execute the code, the syntax is the following:
```bash
python3 stt.py sample_stereo <catalog-division>
```
This will apply the algorithm over the first picture in the sample images. Like the previous cases, catalog division 
can be 5, 10 or 15. The attitude information can be read from the STEREO image header. 
Several programs can be used for it, for example, [DS9](https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9). <br />
If you want to test another picture, you can try:
```bash
python3 stt.py sample_stereo <catalog-division> --npic <picture-number>
```
In this case, the argument *picture-number* ranges from 1 to 10.

## 5.- Research

This STT is deeply tested with theoretical analysis and ground-based night-sky pictures.
